'''What Is a Module in Python?
A module is simply a Python file (.py) that contains functions, classes, or variables you can reuse in other programs.
Think of it as a code library — instead of rewriting the same logic, you import it from a module.

 Why Use Modules?
-  Organize code into logical sections
-  Reuse code across multiple programs
-  Improve readability and maintainability
-  Avoid duplication '''

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b
